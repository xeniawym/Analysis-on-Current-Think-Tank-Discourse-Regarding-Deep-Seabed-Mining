This project aims to analyze the current discourse trends surrounding deep sea mining within think tanks spanning the political spectrum, based on the listings provided by the Citizen Source website. The author conducted comprehensive research on the websites of these think tanks. Among them, three think tanks align with conservative viewpoints: the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Hoover Institution, and Heritage Foundation. Additionally, five think tanks with centrist and liberal perspectives include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Wilson Center, Pew Charitable Trust, and Scientific America. Consequently, this project will place special emphasis on these eight institutions.

The primary objective of this project is to manually gather all publications related to deep sea mining from the aforementioned eight think tanks, each representing distinct political inclinations. The analysis will focus on publications released after July 2023. This endeavor seeks to provide insights into five key questions:

1. What are the ongoing debates centered around?
   - Current discussions encompass national security, global development and inequality, economic aspects, and the imperative need for additional scientific research.

2. What are the notable keywords and phrases associated with deep sea mining?
   - Conservative think tanks, notably the Wilson Center, predominantly emphasize the national security aspects of critical minerals. Frequently mentioned terms include "China," "critical minerals," "Arctic competition," "security," and "strategy." Conversely, science-oriented think tanks employ terminology such as "sea floor," "species," "impact," "conservation," and emphasize the importance of "data." Liberal and centrist think tanks address regional inequalities, economic facets, and development impacts, with common words like "Pacific island," "developing countries," "global," and "income."

3. How do the perspectives of conservative and liberal/centrist think tanks vary concerning this matter?
   - An examination of keywords such as 'security,' 'critical,' 'conservation,' 'environment,' 'community,' 'economic,' 'development,' and 'rights' reveals whether the political leanings of think tanks align with their stances on deep sea mining. For example, the Heritage Foundation places significant emphasis on security, Pew concentrates on conservation, and the Wilson Center highlights critical minerals and security. However, other institutes do not exhibit significant IF-IDF scores. This suggests that the political orientations of think tanks only partially influence their positions on deep sea mining. Currently, both conservative and liberal think tanks address national security, though conservatives tend to place less emphasis on conservation, while the term "conservation" remains relevant in the publications of centrist and liberal think tanks.

4. Which organizations or institutions lead research in this area?
   - The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and Pew Research are at the forefront of research in this field. All institutes primarily favor articles as their primary publication format, although podcasts are gaining popularity. Notable authors in this domain include James Pethokoukis and Julian Jackson. The number of publications reached its zenith in July, coinciding with the ISA negotiation period.

5. What is the prevailing sentiment or perspective regarding deep sea mining in think tank publications?
   - A sentiment analysis assesses the compound, positive, and negative scores of each publication. The results reveal that, in general, all publications related to deep sea mining convey a positive sentiment. However, two publications from Yale Environment and two from CSIS present a negative tone when discussing topics such as "blue scars" and "wildfire."
